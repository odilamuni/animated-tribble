#RNA transcriber:

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).
Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.
The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).
Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
A -> U
Create a user interface for this project using HTML and CSS.  


#Jaden Case:

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word.
Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.
Example:
Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real" Jaden-Cased: "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
Other Jaden quotes you can try out: 1. "The More Time You Spend Awake The More Time You Spend Asleep." 2. "Currently Going Through Customs 

#Number guessing game

Create a number guessing game that will ask a user to guess the correct number.
Give the user clues like 'Too High' or 'Too Low.'
After 5 incorrect guesses, the program should tell you that you lose. It should tell you all the numbers you have guessed, and what the correct answer is.
AND create a user interface for your game using html and css.
For regular mode, you can choose the number and set it to a variable. For harder and nightmare mode, use Math.random to generate a number.
Push your code to github.â€‹
